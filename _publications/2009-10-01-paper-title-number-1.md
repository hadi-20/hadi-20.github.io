excerpt: 'Vehicle classification in videos has broad applications in intelligent transportation and smart cities. The vehicle classes are defined according to the Federal Highway Association (FHWA) vehicle types, and two popular deep learning methods, namely, the Faster R-CNN and the YOLO, are applied for vehicle classification. The Faster R-CNN and the YOLO are two representative deep learning methods with applications in object detection and classification. First, three training data sets are manually created from two videos in the low video quality category for training the Faster R-CNN and the YOLO deep learning methods. Second, new videos that are not seen during training are used to evaluate the vehicle classification performance for the deep learning methods. In particular, the comparative evaluation includes the training time, the testing time, the vehicle classification accuracy, as well as the generalization performance of the deep learning methods. The experiments using the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) traffic videos show the feasibility of vehicle classification in videos using deep learning methods.'
