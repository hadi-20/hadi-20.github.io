excerpt: 'Traffic accident detection is an important topic in traffic video analysis, and this paper discusses single-vehicle traffic accident detection. Specifically, a novel real-time traffic accident detection framework, which consists of an automated traffic region detection method, a new traffic direction estimation method, and a first-order logic traffic accident detection method, is presented in this paper. First, the traffic region detection method applies the general flow of traffic to detect the location and boundaries of the roads. Second, the traffic direction estimation method estimates the moving direction of the traffic. The rationale for estimating the traffic direction is that the crashed vehicles often make rapid changes of directions. Third, traffic accidents are detected using the first-order logic decision-making system. Experimental results using the real traffic video data show the feasibility of the proposed method. In particular, traffic accidents are detected in real-time in the traffic videos without any false alarms.'
